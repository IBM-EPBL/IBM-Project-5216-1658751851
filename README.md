   Effective drowning detection methods are essential
for the safety of swimmers. In this paper, a novel type of
drowning detection method addressing many limitations of
prevailing drowning detectors is proposed. The proposed
method ensures detection of drowning and reporting at the
earlier stages. The proposed drowning detection method is also
a generic solution that suites different water bodies from pools
to oceans, and an economically viable method useful for both
low and middle income countries. The prototype of the
drowning detection method is developed and demonstrated and
model of the system is simulated in Proteus design suite. The
results of the simulation and hardware experimentation are also
reported. 

        1. Swimming is one of the best exercises that helps people to reduce stress in this urban lifestyle. Swimming pools are found larger in number in hotels.

        2. Applying the CNN algorithm to the dataset.Beginners, especially, often feel it difficult to breathe underwater which causes breathing trouble which in turn causes a drowning accident.

        3.To overcome this conflict, a meticulous system is to be implemented along the swimming pools to save human life.
